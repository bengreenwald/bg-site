I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven insights and human-centered design to create meaningful impact for products, businesses, and the communities they serve. I'm currently a Senior Product Data Analyst at {{< newtabref href="https://www.modernhealth.com/" title="Modern Health" >}}, where I'm focused on helping to improve mental health outcomes for people and communities across the world. The tools with which I work most frequently are R, Snowflake, dbt, Mixpanel, and Looker. My other favorites (so far) include Tableau, Google Analytics, Figma, and Airtable.

Most recently as a Senior Product Analyst at {{< newtabref href="https://www.niche.com/" title="Niche" >}}, I analyzed user engagement and behavior data to drive impactful product initiatives and decisions in service of helping students and their families to find schools where they most belong. Previously as a Senior Data Analyst at CompassRed and {{< newtabref href="https://www.labware.com/lims/ml-ai" title="LabWare Analytics" >}}, I managed projects, built custom tools, and designed data products for clients across industries including education, healthcare, laboratory testing, marketing, and IT/security. I also have several years of experience in higher education with {{< newtabref href="https://www.gse.upenn.edu/about-penn-gse/catalyst" title="Catalyst @ Penn GSE" >}}, where I analyzed program data and led initiatives to support entrepreneurs, school leaders, and other innovators shaping the future of education.

Outside of work, you can usually find me diving deep on soccer tactics (and supporting Tottenham Hotspur and the Philadelphia Union), exploring a new recipe in the kitchen, savoring a great scotch, or gushing about my husky mix Poppy.
