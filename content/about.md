I'm passionate about design-oriented analytics that drive meaningful impact for businesses and the communities they serve. Currently as a Product Analyst at {{< newtabref href="https://www.niche.com/" title="Niche" >}}, I leverage data to help students and families discover schools, colleges, and communities where they most belong. The tools with which I work most frequently are R, Snowflake, Google Analytics, and Tableau. My other favorites (so far) include Figma, Looker Studio, and Airtable.

Previously as a Senior Data Analyst at {{< newtabref href="https://www.compassred.com/" title="CompassRed" >}} and {{< newtabref href="https://www.labware.com/lims/ml-ai" title="LabWare Analytics" >}}, I managed projects, built custom tools, and designed data products for clients across industries including education, healthcare, laboratory testing, marketing, and IT/security. I also have several years of experience in higher education with {{< newtabref href="https://www.gse.upenn.edu/about-penn-gse/catalyst" title="Catalyst @ Penn GSE" >}}, where I analyzed program data and led initiatives to support entrepreneurs, school leaders, and other innovators shaping the future of education.

Outside of work, you can usually find me diving deep on soccer tactics (and supporting Tottenham Hotspur and the Philadelphia Union), savoring a great scotch, or gushing about my husky mix Poppy.
